4,5,10,20,20,"Since the hoop has a radius of 12.5 inches, it has a circumference of: 2 x π x 12.5 = 25π = 25 x 3.14 = 78.5 inches Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 75 feet is equivalent to 75 x 12 = 900 inches. Thus, it will take 900/78.5 = 11.46 revolutions to roll the hoop 75 feet across the surface. Since each revolution takes 10 seconds, 11.46 revolutions will take 114.6 seconds, or approximately 2 minutes.","Q. 14 Sarah is sprinting straight ahead from Kartik at a speed of 20 feet per second. Meanwhile, Kartik is running after Maya, who is ahead by 100 feet, at a speed of 25 feet per second. How many seconds will it take for Kartik to catch up to Maya?"
1,2,3,4,2,"Let the distance run be x miles and the distance walked be y miles. We have, x + y = 8 …(i) Also, time taken = 3 hours Therefore, x/6 + y/2 = 3 …(ii) Solving (i) for y, we get y = 8 – x Substituting this value of y in (ii), we get x/6 + (8 – x)/2 = 3 ⇒ x/6 + 4 – x/2 = 3 ⇒ x/6 – x/2 = 3 – 4 ⇒ (x – 3x)/6 = -1 ⇒ -2x/6 = -1 ⇒ -2x = -6 ⇒ x = 3 Therefore, y = 8 – 3 = 5 Hence, the ratio of the distance walked to the distance traveled = y : (x + y) = 5 : (3 + 5) **= 5 : 8**",Q. 15 A hoop that has a 12.5-inch radius is rolled along a flat path. It takes the hoop 10 seconds to finish one full turn. How many minutes will it take for the hoop to roll a distance of 75 feet?
3/8,1/2,5/6,5/8,5/8,"To solve this problem, let’s first understand Kendra’s current situation and the constraints she faces. Kendra hikes at a constant rate of 12 minutes per kilometer. She has already hiked 2.75 kilometers east, which means she took: 2.75  km × 12  minutes per km = 33  minutes 2.75 Now, Kendra realizes she needs to return to the start and has 45 minutes to do so. Since she needs time to get back, we have to figure out how much further she can hike east before she must turn back. When she turns back, she will retrace her path at the same rate. The total hiking time when going further east and then back to the start must equal 45 minutes. Since she has already spent 33 minutes hiking, she has: 45  minutes – 33  minutes = 12  minutes 45 left to hike back towards the starting point. **Determining maximum eastward distance before turning back:** Since Kendra uses 12 minutes to cover 1 kilometer, in 12 minutes she will be able to cover: 12  minutes 12  minutes per km = 1  kilometer Thus, she can continue hiking east for 0.5 kilometers before she would need to immediately turn around since it would take her 6 minutes to hike this extra 0.5 kilometers and another 6 minutes to get back to this point, totaling 12 minutes. **Total distance hiked east before turning back:** Adding this 0.5 kilometers to the initial 2.75 kilometers, she hiked a total distance of: 2.75  km + 0.5  km = 3.25  kilometers 2.75 So, Kendra hiked a total of 3.25 kilometers east.","Q. 16 Sarah covered 8 miles and took 3 hours, moving at either 6 miles per hour while running or 2 miles per hour while walking. How much of the distance did she walk compared to the total distance traveled?"
