Initially, there are 8 liters of a 45% saline solution, which means there are 0.45*8 = 3.6 liters of saline and 4.4 liters of water. After the water evaporates, there are 8-x liters of solution left. Since the solution is now 60% saline, there are 0.6*(8-x) = 4.8-0.6x liters of saline. We know that the amount of saline remains constant, so we can set up the following equation: 3.6 = 4.8-0.6x Solving for x, we get: x = 2 liters Therefore, approximately 2 liters of water evaporated from the solution.","Q. 13 There are eight liters of a solution that contains 45% salt.
