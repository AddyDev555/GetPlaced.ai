1.7,2.7,3.7,4.2,2.7,We can move variables on one side and numbers on other side. 13x – 6x = 12 + 7 7x = 19,"Q. 12 Solve for x, given the equation: 13x – 12 = 6x + 7"
1.9,2.9,3.9,4.4,2.9,We should aim to make the coefficient of y same. For that we need to take LCM of coefficient of y in both the equations. LCM = 24 Now multiply equation 1 with 8 and equation 2 with 3 to get the equations as: 16x + 24y = 16 and 24x + 24y = 39. Subtract the equations to solve for x now.

5,10,12,15,15,"Let’s assume Bernad’s present age to be x. Then, Alex’s present age would be x + 10. Five years ago, Bernad’s age would be x – 5, and Alex’s age would be (x + 10) – 5 = x + 5. Given that 5 years ago, Alex was twice as old as Bernad. So, we can write: x + 5 = 2(x – 5) Solving for x: x + 5 = 2x – 10 x = 15 Therefore, Bernad’s present age is 15 years","Q. 14 Alex has a 10-year age advantage over Bernad. Five years earlier, Alex’s age was double that of Bernad’s. What is Bernad’s current age?"
