24,48,60,120,48,"We have 7 total ducks, including one adult male, one adult female, and one ugly duckling. We need to determine the number of ways the ducks can line up with the adult ducks at each end and the ugly duckling in the center. In the first spot, we have 2 choices (since it can be 1 of the 2 adult ducks). In the second spot, we have 4 choices (since it can be any 1 of the 4 non-ugly ducklings). In the third spot, we have 3 choices (since it can be any 1 of the 3 remaining non-ugly ducklings). In the fourth spot, i.e., the center spot, we have only 1 choice (since it must be the ugly duckling). In the fifth spot, we have 2 choices (since it can be any 1 of the 2 remaining non-ugly ducklings). In the six spot, we have 1 choice (since it must be the last remaining non-ugly duckling). In the seventh spot, i.e., the last position, we have 1 choice (since it must be the other adult duck).

5,10,48,72,72,"To solve this problem, we can first calculate the total number of unrestricted seating arrangements and then subtract the number of arrangements where Anya and Xavier are sitting next to each other. 1. **Total number of unrestricted arrangements:** There are 5 people (Anya, Peter, Martha, Xavier, Ed). If there are no restrictions, any of the 5 people can sit in the first seat, any of the remaining 4 can sit in the second seat, and so on. This is a permutation of 5 people, calculated as: 5 ! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 5 2. **Arrangements where Anya and Xavier are sitting next to each other:** To simplify this, consider Anya and Xavier as a single unit. This effectively reduces the number of units to arrange from 5 to 4 (the unit “Anya-Xavier”, plus Peter, Martha, Ed). – The unit “Anya-Xavier” can be arranged in 2 ways (Anya can be first or Xavier can be first). – The total arrangement for the 4 units is 4 ! 4 , as there are now 4 units to arrange: 4 ! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 4 – Since the Anya-Xavier unit can be arranged in 2 ways, multiply their internal arrangements by the other possible arrangements of the units: 2 × 24 = 48 2 3. **Subtract the restricted arrangements from the total arrangements:** Subtract the number of arrangements where Anya and Xavier are next to each other from the total number of unrestricted arrangements: 120 – 48 = 72 120 Therefore, there are 72 different seating arrangements possible where Anya and Xavier are not sitting next to each other.","Q. 12 Anya, Peter, Martha, Xavier, and Ed are seated on a bench.

28,49,56,64,56,"To find the total number of matches played in the first round of the Indian Premier League with each team playing every other team exactly twice, we follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the Number of Matches if Each Team Played Every Other Team Once:** There are 8 teams, and each team plays every other team exactly once. The number of such matches can be calculated using the combination formula, which in this context is: C ( n , 2 ) = n ( n − 1 ) 2 where n n is the number of teams. Here, n = 8 , so: C ( 8 , 2 ) = 8 × 7 2 = 28 This means there would be 28 matches if each team played every other team exactly once. 2. **Each Team Plays Every Other Team Twice:** Since each match scenario is played twice, the total number of matches will be: 28 × 2 = 56 28 Therefore, the total number of matches played in the first round with each team playing every other team exactly twice is 56.","Q. 13 In the Indian Premier League, there are 8 teams and each team plays two matches against each of the other teams in the first round.

12312,22536,4320,11268,22536,"Since, one child cannot have more than two brands of chocolates, therefore, one child can get a maximum of six chocolates. When there are four winners, the winners can have the chocolates in the following possible way Case I One of them gets six chocolates and the other three get one each. The one who gets six chocolates can be selected in 4C1 ways and he will get any two brands out of three in 3C2 ways. The three chocolates of the same brand will be distributed among the other three in 3! ways. Hence, the total number of ways = 4 × 3 × 6 = 72 Case II One of them gets 5 chocolates, one of them gets 2 chocolates and the other two get 1 each. Kid with 5 chocolates: The one who gets five chocolates can be selected in 4C1 ways and he will get any two brands out of three in 3C2 ways. After choosing the two brands (say A & B), he can get all three chocolates of one brand in 2 ways (i.e. either A or B). The other two chocolates can be chosen from the second brand in 3 ways. Thus, there are 4 × 3 × 2 × 3 = 36 ways Kid with 2 chocolates: This person can be chosen in 3 ways. Now, he can either get two chocolates from the same brand or from two different brands. Thus, there are 6 × 3 = 18 ways Kids with 1 chocolate each The remaining chocolates can be distributed between the two remaining winners in 2 ways. Therefore, total number of ways = 36 × 18 × 2 = 1296 ways. Case III Similarly for four chocolates the following combinations are possible: a) 4 3 1 1 The number of ways = 4 × 3 × [{6 × 3(1 + ( 6 + 3))} + {1 × 9 × 3 (1 + 6)}] × 2 = 8856 b) 4 2 2 1 The number of ways = 4 × 3 × [{6 × 3(2 × 6 × 3 + (3 + 9))} + {9 × (9 + 9)}] = 12312 Since, the best of them can’t have less than 4 chocolates the above are the only cases applicable. Hence, the total number of ways = 72 + 1296 + (8856 + 12312) = 22536.","Q. 15 Five children were walking and stopped at a store displaying three different chocolate brands: Cadbury, Nestle, and Ferrero. Each brand offered three unique flavors of chocolate, yielding a total of nine chocolates. The children purchased all nine chocolates and decided that only game winners could receive them. The rule was established that no single winner could obtain chocolates from all three brands. Determine how many ways the nine chocolates can be distributed among four winners if the top winner receives at least four chocolates."
648,300,252,225,300,"The digit 6 is used once in 100~109 (only when 106). Similarly the digit 6 is used once in 110~119(only when 116), …. in 150~159(only when 156), in 170~179(only when 176), in 190~199(only when 196). On the other hand in 160~169 the digit 6 is used at unit digit(166) and at tenth digit(16□). So the digit 6 is used 11 times(=1 (unit digit)+10 (tenth digit)) in 160~169. That means the digit 6 is used 20 in 100~199. Similarly in 200~299 : 20 times 300~399 : 20 times …. 500~599 : 20 times 700~799 : 20 times …. 800~899 : 20 times 900~999 : 20 times On the other hand in 600~699 we should consider hundredth digit so 6 is 100 times more used. That means the digit 6 is used 120 in 600~699. So total number of digit 6 is 20*10 + 100= 300.",Q. 16 How many times digit 6 is used while writing numbers from 100 to 1000 ?
