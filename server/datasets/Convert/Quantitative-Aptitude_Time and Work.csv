24 days,20 days,40 days,45 days,24 days,"Total work = ( LCM ( 40 , 30 ) = 120 ) ( units. A and B’s rate = ( 120 40 + 120 30 = 3 + 4 = 7 ) units/day. In 10 days, A and B do ( 10 × 7 = 70 ) ( units. Remaining work = ( 120 – 70 = 50 ) ( units in 5 days. C’s rate = ( 50 5 = 10 ) units/day, so C alone takes ( 120 10 = 24 ) days.
