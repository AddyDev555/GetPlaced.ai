"What is the value of c , If 8 is 4% of a, and 4 is 8% of b. c equals b/a.",12,1/4,1/4,0.155,None of these,"Let be the 4% of a is 4a/100.Since this equals 8, we have 4a/100=8.Solving for a yields a=8×`(100/4)`=200.Also, 8% of b equals 8b/100, and this equals 4. Hence, we have `(8/100)`×b=4. Solving for b yields  b = 50.Now, c=`b/a`=`50/200`=`1/4.`"
"Half percent, written as a decimal, is",0.2,0.02,0.005,0.005,0.05,"As we know, 1% = 1/100Hence, (1/2)% = (1/2 * 1/100) = 1/200 = 0.005"
Fresh fruit contains 68% water and dry fruit contains 20% water. How much dry fruit can be obtained from 100 kg of fresh fruits ?,20,30,40,40,50,"The fruit content in both the fresh fruit and dry fruit is the same.Given, fresh fruit has 68% water. So remaining 32% is fruit content. Weight of fresh fruits is 100kgDry fruit has 20% water. So remaining 80% is fruit content. Let weight of dry fruit be y kg.Fruit % in freshfruit = Fruit% in dryfruit`(32/100) ** 100 = (80/100 ) ** y`We get, y = 40 kg"
A shepherd has 1 million sheep at the beginning of Year 2000. The numbers grow by x during the year. A famine hits his village in the next year and many of his sheep die. The sheep population decreases by y during 2001 and at the beginning of 2002 the shepherd finds that he is left with 1 million sheep. Which of the following is correct? ,x>y,y>x,x>y,x=y,cannot be determined,"Let us assume the value of x to be 10%Therefore, the number of sheep in the herd at the beginning of year 2001 (end of 2000) will be 1 million + 10% of 1 million = 1.1 millionIn 2001, the numbers decrease by y% and at the end of the year the number sheep in the herd = 1 million.i.e., 0.1 million sheep have died in 2001.In terms of the percentage of the number of sheep alive at the beginning of 2001,it will be `(0.1/1.1) ** 100% = 9.09%`From the above illustration it is clear that x>yx"
"X and Y invest Rs.21000 and Rs.17500 respectively in a business. At the end of the year, they make a profit of Rs.26400. What is the share of X in the profit?",14400,26400,14400,12000,12500,Ratio of the investment = `21000 : 17500 = 210 : 175 = 42 : 35 = 6 : 5`Share of X in the profit = `26400 ** (6/11) = 2400 ** 6 = 14400`
"Kamal started a business with Rs.25000 and after 4 months, Kiran joined him with Rs.60000. Kamal received Rs.58000 including 10% of profit as commission for managing the business. What amount did Kiran receive?",75000,70000,72000,72000,78000,Ratio of the profits = 25000*12 : 60000*8= 25*12 : 60*8 = 5*3 : 12:2 = 5 : 4*2= 5:8Let the total profit = x.Then Kamal received `(10x)/100 = x/10` as commission for managing the businessRemaining profit = `x- x/10 = (9x)/10` which is shared in the ration 5:8Kamal's share = `x/10 + ((9x)/10) * (5/13) = 58000`=> `x + 9x(5/13) = 580000`=> `x(1 + 45/13) = 580000`=> `x ( 58/13) = 580000`=> `x ( 1/13) = 10000`=> `x = 130000`Kiran's share = 130000 - 58000 = 72000
"A & B partner in a business , A contribute 1/4 of the capital for 15 months & B received 2/3 of the profit . For how long B's money was used ?",12 months,10 months,10 months,14 months,16 months,B received 2/3 of the profit=> A : B = `1/3 : 2/3 = 1:2`Let the total capital = xThen A's capital = `x/4`B's capital = `x – x/4 = (3x)/4`Assume B's money was used for b monthsThen A:B = `(x/4)**15 : ((3x)/4)**b = 1 : 2`=> `15/4 : (3b)/4 = 1 : 2`=> `15 : 3b = 1 : 2`=> `5 : b = 1 : 2`=> `5/b = 1/ 2`=> `b = 5**2 = 10`
What is 12 percent of 80 percent of 50?,5,6,4.8,4.8,3.6,12% of 80% of 50= 12% of `(80/100 ** 50)`= 12% of 40= `12/100 ** 40`= 4.8
