A runs 25% faster than B and is able to allow B a lead of 7 meters to end a race in dead heat. What is the length of the race?,10 meters,25 meters,35 meters,35 meters,5 meters,"A runs 25% as fast as B.That is, if B runs 100m in a given time, then A will run 125m in the same timeIn other words, if A runs 5m in a given time, then B will run 4m in the same time.Therefore, if the length of a race is 5m, then A can give B a start of 1m so that they finish the race in a dead heat.Start : length of race :: 1 : 5In this question, we know that the start is 7m.Hence, the length of the race will be 7 * 5 = 35m."
