The number of oranges in three basket are in the ratio 3 : 4 : 5. In which ratio the no. of oranges in first two basket must be increased so that the new ratio becomes 5 : 4 : 3 ?,3:4,2:1,2:1,2:3,1:3,"Let,B1 : B2 : B3 = 3x : 4x : 5xAgain,B1 : B2 : B3 = 5y : 4y : 3yNumber of oranges remain constant in third basket as increase in oranges takes place only in first two baskets.Hence, 5x = 3y`x=(3y)/5`and,3x : 4x : 5x→ `(9y) /5 : (12y) /5 : (15y) /5 = 9y : 12y : 15y`And,5y : 4y : 3y → 25y : 20y : 15yTherefore, Increment in first basket = 16.Increment in second basket = 8.Thus, Required ratio = 16 /8 = 2 : 1"
"A mixture contains alcohol and water in the ratio 4 : 3. If 5 liters of water is added to the mixture, the ratio becomes 4: 5. Find the quantity of alcohol in the given mixture.",10,12,10,15,18,Let the quantity of alcohol and water be 4x litres and 3x litres respectively20x = 4(3x+5)8x = 20x = 2.5Quantity of alcohol = (4 x 2.5) litres = 10 litres.
