Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Answer,Solution
A sum of money placed at compound interest doubles itself in 4 years. In how many years will it amount to 8 times?,9 years,8 years,27 years,12 years,12 years,"Let,Principal = Rs. 100.Amount = Rs. 200.Rate = r%Time = 4 years.Now,`A = P*[1+ (r/100)]^n`;`200 = 100*[1+(r/100)]^4`;`2 = [1+(r/100)]^4`; ........... (i)If sum become 8 times in the time n years,then,`8 = (1+(r/100))^n`;`2^3 = (1+(r/100))^n`; ........(ii)Using eqn (i) in (ii), we get;`([1+(r/100)]^4)^3 = (1+(r/100))^n`;`[1+(r/100)]^12 = (1+(r/100))^n`;Thus, n = 12 years."
The difference between simple and compound interest for the fourth year is Rs. 7280 at 20% p.a. What is the principal sum?,78653,67000,50000,55000,50000,"Difference between CI and SI for nth year,= `((Pr) /100) *[(1 +(r /100))^(n-1) -1]`→ `7280 = ((P*20)/100) *[(1.2)^3-1]`→ P = 50000."
