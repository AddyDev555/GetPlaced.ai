Question,Option A,Option B,Answer,Option C,Option D,Solution
"A clock loses 1% time during the first week and then gains 2% time during the next one week. If the clock was set right at 12 noon on a Sunday, what will be the time shown by the clock exactly 14 days from the time it was set right?",1:36:48,1:40:48,1:40:48,1:41:24,10:19:12,"The clock loses 1% time during the first week.In a day there are 24 hours and in a week there are 7 days. Therefore, there are 7 * 24 = 168 hours in a week.If the clock loses 1% time during the first week, then it will show a time which is 1% of 168 hours less than 12 Noon at the end of the first week = 1.68 hours less.Subsequently, the clock gains 2% during the next week. The second week has 168 hours and the clock gains 2% time = 2% of 168 hours = 3.36 hours more than the actual time.As it lost 1.68 hours during the first week and then gained 3.36 hours during the next week, the net result will be a -1.68 + 3.36 = 1.68 hour net gain in time.So the clock will show a time which is 1.68 hours more than 12 Noon two weeks from the time it was set right.1.68 hours = 1 hour and 40.8 minutes = 1 hour + 40 minutes + 48 seconds.i.e. 1 : 40 : 48 P.M."
if it takes 60 seconds to complete one round around the clock what would be the time required to complete 1200 rounds of the same clock,1200 minutes,3 hours,1200 minutes,42000 secs,45000 secs,1 round takes 60 seconds.1200 rounds will take ? seconds.? = 1200 * 60 seconds = 72000 seconds.Not in option. So we check for minutes.`(1200 * 60) / 60 = 1200 min`
