"If each edge of a cube is increased by 50%, find the percentage increase in its surface area.",125%,125%,150%,175%,110%,Let the edge = `a` cm So increase by `50%` = `a+a/2 = 3a/2`Total surface Area of original cube = `6a^2`TSA of new cube = `6(3a/2)^2``6 xx 9a^2/4 = 13.5a^2`Increase in area = `13.5a^2 - 6a^2 = 7.5a^2` `7.5a^2` Increase % = `(7.5a^2)/(6a^2) xx 100 = 125%`
The diagonal of a rectangle is  cm and its area is 20 sq. cm. Theperimeter of the rectangle must be:,18,18,28,38,48,"`sqrt(l^2+b^2) = sqrt(41)` (or) `l^2+b^2 = 41`Also, `lb = 20``(l+b)^2 = l^2 + b^2 + 2lb`"
An error 2% in excess is made while measuring the side of a square. What is the percentage of error in the calculated area of the square?,4.04 %,4.04 %,2.02 %,4 %,2 %,Error = 2% while measuring the side of a square.Let the correct value of the side of the square = 100Then the measured value = 100 + (2% of 100) = 100 +2 = 102 (∵ error 2% in excess)Correct Value of the area of the square = 100 × 100 = 10000Calculated Value of the area of the square = 102 × 102 = 10404Error = 10404 - 10000 = 404Percentage Error=4.04%ErrorActual Value×100=40410000×100=4.04%
"A towel, when bleached, lost 20% of its length and 10% of its breadth. What is the percentage of decrease in area?",30 %,28 %,28 %,32 %,26 %,Solution 1:Let original length = 100 and original breadth = 100Then original area = 100 × 100 = 10000Lost 20% of length=> New length = Original length - (20% of Original Length)100- (20% of 100) = 100-20 = 80Lost 10% of breadth=> New breadth= Original breadth - (10% of original breadth)= 100 - (10% of 100) = 100-10 = 90New area = 80 × 90 = 7200Decrease in area= Original Area - New Area= 10000 - 7200 = 2800Percentage of decrease in area = `(2800/10000) * 100 = 28%`

"The length of a rectangle is twice its breadth. If its length is decreased by 5 cm and breadth is increased by 5 cm, the area of the rectangle is increased by 75 sq.cm. What is the length of the rectangle?",18 cm,40 cm,16 cm,40 cm,20 cm,Let breadth = x cmThen length = 2x cmArea = lb = x × 2x = 2x2New length = (2x - 5)New breadth = (x + 5)New Area = lb = (2x - 5)(x + 5)But given that new area = initial area + 75 sq.cm.=> (2x - 5)(x + 5) = 2x2 + 75=> 2x2 + 10x - 5x - 25 = 2x2 + 75=> 5x - 25 = 75=> 5x = 75 + 25 = 100=> x =1005= 20 cmLength = 2x = 2 × 20 = 40cm
"If the difference between the length and breadth of a rectangle is 23 m and its perimeter is 206 m, what is its area?",2800 m2,2520 m2,2740 m2,2520 m2,2200 m2,"l - b = 23 ....(Equation 1)perimeter = 2(l + b) = 206=> l + b = 103 ....(Equation 2)(Equation 1) + (Equation 2) => 2l = 23 + 103 = 126=> l = 1262 = 63 metreSubstituting this value of l in (Equation 1), we get63 - b = 23=> b = 63 - 23 = 40 metreArea = lb = 63 × 40 = 2520 m2"
