"Sum of present ages of A, B and C is 92 years. If 4 years ago, the ratio of their ages were 1:2:3 respectively, find A’s present age.",18.5 year,14.8 years,17.3 years,17.3 years,20.3 years,"Sum of present ages of A, B and C is = 92 yearsTherefore , Sum of their ages 4 years ago = 92 – (4 * 3)= 80 years.4 years ago ratio of the ages of A , B and C was = 1:2:3Therefore, A’s age four years ago = `1/6` * 80 = 13.3 years.So , A’s present age =13.3 + 4 = 17.3 years"
2 years ago A’s age was 6 times of B’s age. 6 years after the ratio between the ages of A and B becomes 10 : 3. What is A’s present age?,44,38,42,44,34,"Older ratio = 6:1Newer ratio = 10:3Let 2 years ago ages of B and A were x and 6x respectively.`[ (6x+8)/ (x+8)] = 10/3``18x +24 = 10x + 80``8x = 56` `x=7 years`Therefore , 2 years ago , A’s age was 6 * 7 = 42 yearsTherefore, A’s present age = 42 + 2 = 44"
"3 years back average age of A and B was 32. Today average age of A,B and C is 30. What is the age of C?",5,10,15,20,20,"3 years back average age of A and B is`((A-3)+(B-3))/2 = 32`Hence A+B=70Today average of A,B and C is 30 i.e.`(A+B+C)/3=30`A+B+C=90Hence C=A+B+C-A-B=20"
The total age of A and B is 12 years more than the total age of B and C. C is how many years younger than A ?,12,13,14,12,15,(A+B) - (B+C) = 12A - C = 12.C is younger than A by 12 years.
The average age of a class of 22 students is 21 years. The average increased by 1 when the teacher's age also included. What is the age of the teacher?,48,45,43,44,44,"`""Total age of all students"" /22 = 21 `Total age of all students= 22 *21`""Total age of all students + age of the teacher""/(22+1) = 21+1`Total age of all students + age of the teacher = 22 * 23Age of the teacher = 23×22 – 22×21 = 22(23-21) = 22×2 = 44"
"Ayisha's age is 1/6th of her father's age. Ayisha's father's age will be twice the age of Shankar's age after 10 years. If Shankar's eighth birthday was celebrated two years before, then what is Ayisha 's present age.?",10 years,12 years,8 years,5 years,5 years,"Consider Ayisha's present age = xThen her father's age = 6xGiven that Ayisha 's father's age will be twice the age of Shankar's age after 10 years=> Shankar's age after 10 years = `1/2`(6x + 10) = 3x + 5Also given that Shankar's eight birthdays was celebrated two years beforeSo his current age is 8 + 2 = 10 years old=> Shankar's age after 10 years = 10 + 10 = 20=> 3x + 5 = 20=> x = 5Therefore, Ayisha 's present age = 5 years"
"My brother is 3 years elder to me. My father was 28 years of age when my sister was born while my mother was 26 years of age when I was born. If my sister was 4 years of age when my brother was born, then what was the age my father when my brother was born?",35 years,34 years,33 years,32 years,32 years,"Let my age = xThen,My brother's age = x + 3My mother's age = x + 26My sister's age = (x + 3) + 4 = x + 7My father's age = (x + 7) + 28 = x + 35=> age my father when my brother was born = x + 35 – (x + 3) = 32"
"A is as much younger than B as he is older than C. If the sum of the ages of B and C is 50 years, what is exactly the difference between B and A's age?",Data inadequate,3 years,5 years,Data inadequate,2 years,Age of C < Age of A < Age of BGiven that sum of the ages of B and C is 50 years.Let's take B's age = x and C's age = 50-xNow we need to find out B's age – A's age. But we cannot find out this with the given data.
Sobha's father was 38 years of age when she was born while her mother was 36 years old when her brother four years younger to her was born. What is the difference between the ages of her parents?,6 years,5 years,4 years,6 years,3 years,Let Sobha's age = x and her brother's age = x-4Sobha's father's age = x + 38Sobha's mother's age = (x - 4) + 36=> Sobha's father's age - Sobha's mother's age= (x + 38) – [(x - 4) + 36]= x + 38 – x + 4 – 36= 6
My father was 30 years of age when my sister was born. My mother was 38 years of age when I was born. My sister was 6 years of age when my brother was born who is 3 years elder to me. What was the age of my father and my mother during the birth of my brother?,"41,36","24,28","28,24","36,35","36,35","My brother was born 6 years after my sister was born and 3 years before I was born.Age of father during my brother’s birth = (30 + 6) = 36 years.Age of mother during my brother’s birth = (38 – 3) = 35 years.Hence, during the birth of my brother, my father was 36 years old and my mother was 35 years old."
The ratio of the current ages of Ajay and Vijay is 7:4. The ratio between Ajay's age 6 years ago and Vijay's age 6 years from now is 1:1. Find the ratio between Ajay's age after 12 years  and Vijay's age 12 years ago.,12:1,10:1,10:1,1:1,None of these,"Let the current age of Ajay and Vijay be 7x and 4x respectively.`(7x – 6) / (4x + 6) = 1/1`7x – 6 = 4x + 63x = 12x = 4Therefore, `(7x + 12) / (4x – 12) = (7**4 + 12) / (4 ** 4 -12) = 40/4 = 10/1`"
