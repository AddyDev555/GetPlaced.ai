Question,Option A,Answer,Option B,Option C,Option D,Solution
A train 120 meters long is running with a speed of 60 km/hr. In what time will it pass a boy who is running at 6 km/hr in the direction opposite to that in which the train is going?,6.54 sec,6.54 sec,44.32 sec,55 sec,30.2 sec,Speed of train relative to boy= `(60 + 6)` km/hr = 66 km/hr`= [66 xx 5/18]` m/sec = `[55/3]` m/sec.Time taken to pass the boy=` [120 xx 3/55]` sec = 6.54 seconds
"Find the speed of the train, if a train 142 m long passes a pole in 6 seconds.",77.2 km/hr,84.9 km/hr,79.6 km/hr,84.9 km/hr,79.2 km/hr,Speed = `[142/6]` m/sec= `[23.6 ** 18/5]` km/hr = 84.9 km/hr
The driver of a maruti car driving at a speed of 68km/h locates a bus 40m ahead of him. After 10sec the bus is 60m behind. The speed of the bus is,30km/hr,32km/hr,32km/hr,25km/hr,38km/hr,Let the speed of the bus be x m/sspeed of the car = 68km/hr (or) `170/9` m/sin 10s the car covers a distance of 100m (40m + 60m = 100m) at a speed of (`170/9` â€“ x)m/sdistance = speed*time`100 = (170/9 -x) **10`x = `80/9` m/sNow convert it to km/hr which is 32 km/hr
A train 150 m long is running with a speed of 68 kmph. In what time will it pass a man who is running at 8 kmph in the same direction in which the train is going?,6s,9s,9s,10s,12s,Speed of the train relative to man = (68 - 8) kmph = (60* `5/18`) m/sec = (`50/3`)m/secTime taken by the train to cross the man I = Time taken by It to cover 150 m at `50/3` m / sec= 150 *`3/ 50` sec = 9 sec
