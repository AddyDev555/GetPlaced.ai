Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Answer,Option D,Solution
"Find the speed of the boat in still water, if a boat covers a certain distance upstream in 2 hours, while it comes back in 1`1/2` hours. If the speed of the stream be 3 kmph.",12 Kmph,18 Kmph,21 Kmph,21 Kmph,24 Kmph,"Let the speed of the boat in still water be x kmph. Then,Speed downstream = (x + 3) kmph,Speed upstream = (x - 3)kmph.`(x - 3) * 2 = (x + 3) * 3/2`4x - 12 = 3x + 9x = 21kmph."
Mayur takes thrice as long to row a distance against the stream as to row the same distance in favor of the stream. The ratio of the speed of the boat(in still water) and the stream is:,3:1,1:3,2:1,2:1,1:1,"Let speed in still water be x and speed of stream be y(Speed in still water) : (Speed of stream)=x:yDistance is same, then time taken downstream is t, and time taken to travel upstream is 3t.d=d`[(x+y) / t] = [(x-y) / (3t)]` x+y= 3x-3y2x = 4y`x/y = 4/2 = 2/1`x:y = 2:1"
