Question,Option A,Option B,Answer,Option C,Option D,Solution
Functions f and g are defined by:f(x) = 1/x + 3x and g(x) = -1/x + 6x - 4The domain  of (f+g)(x) is:,"(-infinity , 4) U (0 , + infinity)","(-infinity , 0) U (0 , + infinity)","(-infinity , 0) U (0 , + infinity)","(-infinity , 0) U (0 , 9)",None of these,"(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = (1/x + 3x) + (-1/x + 6x - 4)(f + g)(x) = 9 x - 4 Domain of f + g is given by the interval (-infinity , 0) U (0 , + infinity)"
The range of the function f(x)= x2 - 4x + 9 is:,"[5 , 9]","[-5 , +infinity)","[5 , + infinity)","[5 , + infinity)",None of these,"h(x) = x 2 - 4 x + 9 = x 2 - 4 x + 4 - 4 + 9 = (x - 2) 2 + 5(x - 2) 2 >= 0(x - 2) 2 + 5 >= 5Hence minimum value h(x) can have is 5 and maximum can go upto + infinity. So the range is [5 , + infinity)"
