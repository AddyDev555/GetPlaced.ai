    "Option D": "10:19:12",
    "Solution": "The clock loses 1% time during the first week.In a day there are 24 hours and in a week there are 7 days. Therefore, there are 7 * 24 = 168 hours in a week.If the clock loses 1% time during the first week, then it will show a time which is 1% of 168 hours less than 12 Noon at the end of the first week = 1.68 hours less.Subsequently, the clock gains 2% during the next week. The second week has 168 hours and the clock gains 2% time = 2% of 168 hours = 3.36 hours more than the actual time.As it lost 1.68 hours during the first week and then gained 3.36 hours during the next week, the net result will be a -1.68 + 3.36 = 1.68 hour net gain in time.So the clock will show a time which is 1.68 hours more than 12 Noon two weeks from the time it was set right.1.68 hours = 1 hour and 40.8 minutes = 1 hour + 40 minutes + 48 seconds.i.e. 1 : 40 : 48 P.M.",

    "Option B": "5/54",
    "Option C": "1/9",
    "Option D": "2/17",
    "Solution": "The only way to roll higher on one die is if the magicians rolls between 2 and 5, inclusive, with two dice. Where he to roll a six with two dice than there is no way he could eclipse that number by rolling one die.Below is the probability of rolling a certain number with two dice.\u20182\u2019 \u2013 1/36\u20183\u2019 \u2013 2/36\u20184\u2019 \u2013 3/36\u20185\u2019-  4/36Now the only numbers a magician can roll with the one die and win is between 3 and 6, inclusive. The chances of rolling any are always 1/6.Next, we have to combine the probability distribution relating to two dice with that relating to the one.The chances of a magician rolling any given number with one die are 1/6. So let\u2019s start with the lowest number he can roll: a \u20183.\u2019 To win with this roll, he will have to roll a \u20182\u2019 with two dice, the odds of which are 1/36. So .So the chances of him rolling a \u20183\u2019 with one die and winning are 1/216.Let\u2019s repeat this logic for the next roll, \u20184.\u2019 Chances of rolling are 1/6. Only way a \u20184\u2019 wins is if he rolls a \u20182\u2019 or a \u20183\u2019 with two dice.Odds of rolling a \u20182\u2019 with two dice  + odds of rolling a \u20183\u2019 with two dice = . Combine this with the odds of rolling a \u20184\u2019 ( which is 1/6): .If he rolls a \u20185\u2019 with one die, he can win if he rolls a \u20184\u2019 with two dice, the probability is 3/36. He can also win if he rolls a \u20182\u2019 or a \u20183\u2019 with two dice, the number outcomes we just found: 3/36. So we addNext, if he rolls a \u20186\u2019 on one die, he can beat \u20182\u2019 through \u20185\u2019 with the two dice. Number of ways to roll a \u20185\u2019 = 4/36. Combining this with the odds of rolling a \u20186\u2019 on one die with the odds or rolling \u20182\u2019, \u20183\u2019, \u20184\u2019, or \u20185\u2019 with the two dice we get: 10/216.You may be wondering why I left the denominator as 216.
