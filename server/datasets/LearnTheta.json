    "Solution": "To solve this problem, we can first calculate the total number of unrestricted seating arrangements and then subtract the number of arrangements where Anya and Xavier are sitting next to each other. 1. **Total number of unrestricted arrangements:** There are 5 people (Anya, Peter, Martha, Xavier, Ed). If there are no restrictions, any of the 5 people can sit in the first seat, any of the remaining 4 can sit in the second seat, and so on. This is a permutation of 5 people, calculated as: 5 ! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120 5 2. **Arrangements where Anya and Xavier are sitting next to each other:** To simplify this, consider Anya and Xavier as a single unit. This effectively reduces the number of units to arrange from 5 to 4 (the unit \u201cAnya-Xavier\u201d, plus Peter, Martha, Ed). \u2013 The unit \u201cAnya-Xavier\u201d can be arranged in 2 ways (Anya can be first or Xavier can be first). \u2013 The total arrangement for the 4 units is 4 ! 4 , as there are now 4 units to arrange: 4 ! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24 4 \u2013 Since the Anya-Xavier unit can be arranged in 2 ways, multiply their internal arrangements by the other possible arrangements of the units: 2 \u00d7 24 = 48 2 3. **Subtract the restricted arrangements from the total arrangements:** Subtract the number of arrangements where Anya and Xavier are next to each other from the total number of unrestricted arrangements: 120 \u2013 48 = 72 120 Therefore, there are 72 different seating arrangements possible where Anya and Xavier are not sitting next to each other.",

The number of such matches can be calculated using the combination formula, which in this context is: C ( n , 2 ) = n ( n \u2212 1 ) 2 where n n is the number of teams. Here, n = 8 , so: C ( 8 , 2 ) = 8 \u00d7 7 2 = 28 This means there would be 28 matches if each team played every other team exactly once. 2. **Each Team Plays Every Other Team Twice:** Since each match scenario is played twice, the total number of matches will be: 28 \u00d7 2 = 56 28 Therefore, the total number of matches played in the first round with each team playing every other team exactly twice is 56.",

    "Solution": "Since, one child cannot have more than two brands of chocolates, therefore, one child can get a maximum of six chocolates. When there are four winners, the winners can have the chocolates in the following possible way Case I One of them gets six chocolates and the other three get one each. The one who gets six chocolates can be selected in 4C1 ways and he will get any two brands out of three in 3C2 ways. The three chocolates of the same brand will be distributed among the other three in 3! ways. Hence, the total number of ways = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 6 = 72 Case II One of them gets 5 chocolates, one of them gets 2 chocolates and the other two get 1 each. Kid with 5 chocolates: The one who gets five chocolates can be selected in 4C1 ways and he will get any two brands out of three in 3C2 ways. After choosing the two brands (say A & B), he can get all three chocolates of one brand in 2 ways (i.e. either A or B). The other two chocolates can be chosen from the second brand in 3 ways. Thus, there are 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 36 ways Kid with 2 chocolates: This person can be chosen in 3 ways. Now, he can either get two chocolates from the same brand or from two different brands. Thus, there are 6 \u00d7 3 = 18 ways Kids with 1 chocolate each The remaining chocolates can be distributed between the two remaining winners in 2 ways. Therefore, total number of ways = 36 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 2 = 1296 ways. Case III Similarly for four chocolates the following combinations are possible: a) 4 3 1 1 The number of ways = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 [{6 \u00d7 3(1 + ( 6 + 3))} + {1 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 3 (1 + 6)}] \u00d7 2 = 8856 b) 4 2 2 1 The number of ways = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 [{6 \u00d7 3(2 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 3 + (3 + 9))} + {9 \u00d7 (9 + 9)}] = 12312 Since, the best of them can\u2019t have less than 4 chocolates the above are the only cases applicable.

    "Solution": "Since the hoop has a radius of 12.5 inches, it has a circumference of: 2 x \u03c0 x 12.5 = 25\u03c0 = 25 x 3.14 = 78.5 inches Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 75 feet is equivalent to 75 x 12 = 900 inches. Thus, it will take 900/78.5 = 11.46 revolutions to roll the hoop 75 feet across the surface. Since each revolution takes 10 seconds, 11.46 revolutions will take 114.6 seconds, or approximately 2 minutes.",

    "Solution": "Let the distance run be x miles and the distance walked be y miles. We have, x + y = 8 \u2026(i) Also, time taken = 3 hours Therefore, x/6 + y/2 = 3 \u2026(ii) Solving (i) for y, we get y = 8 \u2013 x Substituting this value of y in (ii), we get x/6 + (8 \u2013 x)/2 = 3 \u21d2 x/6 + 4 \u2013 x/2 = 3 \u21d2 x/6 \u2013 x/2 = 3 \u2013 4 \u21d2 (x \u2013 3x)/6 = -1 \u21d2 -2x/6 = -1 \u21d2 -2x = -6 \u21d2 x = 3 Therefore, y = 8 \u2013 3 = 5 Hence, the ratio of the distance walked to the distance traveled = y : (x + y) = 5 : (3 + 5) **= 5 : 8**",

    "Solution": "To solve this problem, let\u2019s first understand Kendra\u2019s current situation and the constraints she faces. Kendra hikes at a constant rate of 12 minutes per kilometer. She has already hiked 2.75 kilometers east, which means she took: 2.75  km \u00d7 12  minutes per km = 33  minutes 2.75 Now, Kendra realizes she needs to return to the start and has 45 minutes to do so. Since she needs time to get back, we have to figure out how much further she can hike east before she must turn back. When she turns back, she will retrace her path at the same rate. The total hiking time when going further east and then back to the start must equal 45 minutes. Since she has already spent 33 minutes hiking, she has: 45  minutes \u2013 33  minutes = 12  minutes 45 left to hike back towards the starting point. **Determining maximum eastward distance before turning back:** Since Kendra uses 12 minutes to cover 1 kilometer, in 12 minutes she will be able to cover: 12  minutes 12  minutes per km = 1  kilometer Thus, she can continue hiking east for 0.5 kilometers before she would need to immediately turn around since it would take her 6 minutes to hike this extra 0.5 kilometers and another 6 minutes to get back to this point, totaling 12 minutes. **Total distance hiked east before turning back:** Adding this 0.5 kilometers to the initial 2.75 kilometers, she hiked a total distance of: 2.75  km + 0.5  km = 3.25  kilometers 2.75 So, Kendra hiked a total of 3.25 kilometers east.",
